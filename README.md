This project will be the client side of the system that assemblers will interact with. Because of this simplicity and ease of use is key, as assembler's should not be expected to figure anything out. Initial development will include the fetching of images and text instructions from the POUI server, and areas for future development includes reporting serial numbers, step build times, etc to the server for tracking.
